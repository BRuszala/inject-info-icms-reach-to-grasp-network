# inject-info-icms-reach-to-grasp-network

The goal of this project was to determine in which of 5 cortical regions in the cortical reach-to-grasp network information could be injected via low-amplitude ICMS: primary somatosensory cortex (S1), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), anterior intraparietal area (AIP), or dorsal posterior pareital cortex (dPPC).  

The uploaded code was written to analyze .h5 files containing all task parameters and behavioral data, .ns2 files containing analog signals of the joystick movements and curosor position of the screen both sampled at 1 kHz, and .nev files that contain event markers to identifiy individual epochs of the task.  All raw data will be provided upon request.
